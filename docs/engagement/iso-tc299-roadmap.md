# ISO/TC 299 Engagement Roadmap

**Status:** Internal working document  
**Closes:** [Issue #7](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/rcan-spec/issues/7)  
**Last updated:** 2026-03-03  
**Audience:** RCAN contributors and maintainers

---

> **Purpose:** This is a practical, internal strategy document for how the RCAN project pursues engagement with ISO/TC 299 (Robotics) and related standards bodies. It is committed to the repo so contributors understand the standardization context and can participate in outreach efforts.

---

## 1. Why Standards Engagement Matters

RCAN addresses a gap that existing robot safety standards do not cover: **AI decision accountability at the protocol layer**. ISO 10218-1:2025 (industrial robot safety), ISO/TS 15066 (collaborative robots), and IEC 62443 (industrial cybersecurity) collectively govern how robots are built, deployed, and secured — but none of them specify how AI-generated commands should be attributed, audited, or bounded.

The EU AI Act (Art. 12, 13, 14) creates a new legal requirement for exactly these capabilities in high-risk AI systems — which includes robots in many deployment contexts. The August 2026 deadline for harmonized EU AI Act standards creates urgency.

Without standards engagement, RCAN risks being perceived as a niche open-source project. With it, RCAN becomes the reference architecture that answers the question: *"How do we add AI accountability to robots?"*

**The goal:** RCAN §6 (audit), §8 (safety invariants), §9 (HiTL gate), and §12 (RBAC) referenced as informative or normative material in an ISO/TC 299 Technical Report or Work Item, and harmonized as the basis for EU AI Act compliance in robotics.

## 2. ISO/TC 299 Structure

**ISO/TC 299** is the ISO technical committee for Robotics. Secretariat: **SIS (Swedish Standards Institute)**.

| Working Group | Scope | Key Output |
|---|---|---|
| **WG 2** | Service robot safety (domestic, professional) | ISO 13482 |
| **WG 3** | Industrial robot safety | ISO 10218-1:2025, ISO 10218-2 |
| **WG 7** | Vocabulary and characteristics | ISO 8373 |
| **JWG 5** | Medical robot safety (joint with ISO/TC 299) | ISO 21281 series |
| **SG 1** | Gaps and Structure | Identification of gaps in existing standards — **directly relevant to RCAN** |

### 2.1 SG 1: Gaps and Structure — The Primary Entry Point

SG 1 (Special Group 1: Gaps and Structure) is explicitly tasked with identifying gaps in existing robotics standards. Its mandate is to find what is NOT covered by current ISO/TC 299 standards and recommend new work items or Technical Reports.

**RCAN addresses a gap SG 1 exists to find.** This is the most direct formal entry point for RCAN into the ISO/TC 299 process.

---

## 3. Entry Point: ISO/TC 299 WG 3 and SG 1

WG 3 (Industrial Robot Safety) produced ISO 10218-1:2025, and SG 1 (Gaps and Structure) is tasked with finding what current ISO/TC 299 standards do not cover. Both are reached through the ISO/TC 299 secretariat or a national member body (in the US, ANSI via A3), not by contacting individuals directly.

**Outreach approach:** lead with the gap, not the project. Offer the technical brief (`docs/whitepaper/ai-accountability-layer-2026.md`) and ask whether AI decision accountability for robot commands is in SG 1's gap inventory.

---

## 4. US Path: A3 / ANSI

A3 administers **ANSI/A3 R15.06-2025** (industrial robot safety, US version of ISO 10218) and holds ISO/TC 299 liaison status. A3 is the US national body pathway into ISO/TC 299.

**Why this matters for RCAN:**
- ANSI membership → access to ISO/TC 299 national body voting and observer seats
- A3 Technical Committee presentation → visibility with US robot safety practitioners
- **Automate conference** (A3's flagship annual event) → talk proposals for practitioner audiences

**Recommended outreach:**
1. Brief introduction to RCAN through A3's standards development office
2. Request: A3 Technical Committee presentation slot (30–45 min) — "AI Decision Accountability at the Protocol Layer"
3. Submit talk proposal to **Automate 2026 or 2027** conference

---

## 5. EU Path: CEN/CENELEC JTC 21

**Contact:** the CEN/CENELEC JTC 21 secretariat (via the CEN-CENELEC website)  
**Subject:** JTC 21 liaison inquiry — RCAN AI accountability specification for robotics

CEN/CENELEC Joint Technical Committee 21 (JTC 21) is developing harmonized standards under the EU AI Act. Organizations with relevant technical specifications can apply for **liaison status**, enabling them to contribute technical content to the standards development process.

**Why RCAN qualifies:**  
RCAN §16 (EU AI Act compliance mappings) maps directly to:
- **Art. 12** — Record-keeping requirements → RCAN §6 audit chain
- **Art. 13** — Transparency and provision of information → RCAN §5 identity + capability manifest
- **Art. 14** — Human oversight → RCAN §16.4 HiTL gate + PENDING_AUTH mechanism

JTC 21's harmonized-standards work is ongoing; check its current work programme before writing.

**Attachments for outreach email:**
- `docs/compliance/eu-ai-act-mapping.md` (article-by-article mapping)
- `docs/whitepaper/ai-accountability-layer-2026.md` (technical brief)

## 6. Engagement Timeline

### 6.1 Immediate (0–3 months)

- [ ] **ISO/TC 299 SG 1** — gap submission via the secretariat or ANSI, with the whitepaper
- [ ] **A3** — introduce RCAN, request a Technical Committee presentation
- [ ] **CEN/CENELEC JTC 21** — liaison inquiry via the secretariat, with attachments
- [ ] **Submit Automate 2026/2027 talk proposal**: "AI Decision Accountability at the Protocol Layer" — abstract due dates vary, check A3 conference site
- [ ] **Publish** `docs/whitepaper/ai-accountability-layer-2026.md` at rcan.dev/whitepaper (PDF + web)

### 6.2 Near-term (3–12 months)

- [ ] **ISO/TC 299 liaison status** — apply via ANSI (requires A3 membership or direct ANSI organizational membership). Budget: ~$1,500–3,000/year for ANSI SMB membership.
- [ ] **WG 3 or SG 1 observer status** — request via ANSI. Observers receive meeting documents and can attend without voting.
- [ ] **Submit RCAN as informative reference** — if any ISO/TC 299 Technical Report is in draft, request inclusion of rcan.dev/spec as an informative reference for AI accountability approaches.
- [ ] **A3 Technical Committee presentation** — 30–45 min slot to present RCAN to US robot safety community.

### 6.3 Medium-term (12–36 months)

- [ ] **ISO Publicly Available Specification (PAS)** — submit RCAN spec as ISO PAS. Requirements:
  - Mature, published specification ✅ (v1.2 at rcan.dev/spec)
  - Reference implementation ✅ (OpenCastor, 4,665+ tests)
  - Documented industry need ✅ (EU AI Act timeline, deployment case studies)
  - National body sponsor — **required**, pursue via ANSI/A3 relationship
- [ ] **Propose new Work Item** — once observer/liaison status established, propose a Work Item in WG 3 or new WG focused on AI accountability requirements for robots.
- [ ] **RCAN OPC UA namespace registration** — submit `https://rcan.dev/opcua/v1` to OPC Foundation namespace registry. Link to ISO/TC 299 engagement as evidence of standards alignment.

### 6.4 Long-term (3–5 years)

- [ ] **Full ISO standard** — conversion of RCAN PAS (or informative Technical Report) to normative ISO standard. Requires:
  - National body sponsorship (ANSI/A3 path)
  - Sustained WG participation (voting member status)
  - Ballot passage across ISO member bodies
  - This timeline is realistic given the EU AI Act urgency creating political will

## 7. Credibility Assets (Current)

These exist today and can be cited immediately in any standards engagement:

| Asset | Location | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| Published specification | [rcan.dev/spec](https://rcan.dev/spec) | Versioned, citable technical specification |
| Reference implementation | [github.com/craigm26/OpenCastor](https://github.com/craigm26/OpenCastor) | 4,665+ tests, deployed on real hardware |
| Compliance documentation | [github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/rcan-spec/docs](https://github.com/RobotRegistryFoundation/rcan-spec/tree/master/docs) | Conformance suite, robot profiles |
| Forensic audit chain | [github.com/craigm26/Quantum-link-Sim](https://github.com/craigm26/Quantum-link-Sim) | §6 audit implementation |
| Technical whitepaper | `docs/whitepaper/ai-accountability-layer-2026.md` | Committee-audience brief |
| ISO 10218 alignment | `docs/compliance/iso-10218-alignment.md` | Clause-by-clause mapping to WG 3 output |
| EU AI Act mapping | `docs/compliance/eu-ai-act-mapping.md` | Article-by-article mapping (Art. 12, 13, 14) |
| Conformance test suite | `scripts/conformance/` | L1/L2/L3 test suite with live checker |
| Robot profiles | `profiles/` | 6 profiles: UR, KUKA, Franka, Spot, generic, custom |
| OPC UA bridge spec | `docs/bridges/opcua-bridge.md` | Standards-adjacent technical depth |
| ROS2 bridge spec | `docs/bridges/ros2-bridge.md` | Ecosystem integration documentation |

**What's missing (to be completed):**

- [ ] PDF version of whitepaper for email attachments
- [ ] Case study: deployment on real hardware with audit chain in production
- [ ] Industry co-signatories (one or two robot manufacturers or integrators willing to say "we evaluated RCAN")
- [ ] ANSI membership (required for ISO/TC 299 voting participation)

## 8. Messaging Guidance

### For ISO/TC 299 (WG 3, SG 1)

Lead with the **gap**, not the project:

> "ISO 10218-1:2025 defines how robots must behave safely. It does not specify how AI-generated commands must be attributed, audited, or bounded at the protocol level. As AI agents increasingly operate robots, this gap creates accountability uncertainty. RCAN provides a concrete specification for this layer."

Cite: `docs/compliance/iso-10218-alignment.md` to show clause-by-clause awareness of ISO 10218.

### For EU/CEN-CENELEC (JTC 21)

Lead with the **regulatory deadline**:

> "RCAN §6 and §9 provide a concrete technical specification for EU AI Act Art. 12, 13, and 14 requirements for robots. With harmonized standards needed by August 2026, RCAN offers a reference architecture that is already implemented and tested."

Cite: `docs/compliance/eu-ai-act-mapping.md`

### For US (A3 / Automate)

Lead with **industry adoption friction**:

> "As AI agents begin commanding robots on factory floors, integrators face a question with no current standard answer: how do you prove the robot was authorized to take that action, which AI model authorized it, and what the confidence level was? RCAN answers this question with a protocol-level specification that works alongside OPC UA and ROS2."

## 9. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Standards bodies move slowly; RCAN reaches adoption before standardization | High | Standards engagement supplements adoption, doesn't gate it. Adoption makes the standards case stronger. |
| Larger organizations submit competing proposals | Medium | Submit RCAN as open specification with permissive licensing. Compete on technical merit and reference implementation depth. |
| EU AI Act harmonization proceeds without robotics input | Low | JTC 21 outreach and A3 liaison engagement address this. August 2026 deadline creates urgency for JTC 21 to engage domain experts. |
| WG 3 views AI accountability as out of scope | Low | SG 1's explicit mandate is to find gaps. The EU AI Act creates regulatory pressure that makes WG 3 expansion of scope likely. |
