# Conformity Assessment Template for RCAN-Based Robot AI Systems

**Regulation:** EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689), Article 43  
**RCAN spec version:** 1.6  
**Document type:** Conformity assessment template  
**Status:** Normative guidance  
**Applies from:** 2 August 2026  

---

## Overview

Article 43 specifies conformity assessment procedures for high-risk AI systems. For AI systems under Annex III (including autonomous robots), providers must follow either:
- **Annex VI** — Internal control (self-assessment by provider), OR
- **Annex VII** — Assessment by a notified body (required when no harmonised standard covers the system)

This template supports **Annex VI internal control**, which is the default path for RCAN-compliant systems that follow the harmonised technical requirements.

## Section 5 — RCAN Conformance Evidence

RCAN protocol conformance (see [rcan.dev/compatibility](https://rcan.dev/compatibility)) is the primary technical evidence of compliance with the harmonised requirements of Articles 9–17.

**Required minimum score:** 80/100, with 0 `fail`-level findings on safety checks.

```
RCAN conformance report:
  Date:         [FILL]
  Tool version: castor validate [version]
  Config:       [FILL path]
  Score:        [FILL]/100
  Passed:       [FILL]
  Warned:       [FILL]
  Failed:       0  ← required

Key passing checks (must all pass for conformity):
  ✅ safety.local_safety_wins
  ✅ safety.emergency_stop_configured
  ✅ safety.watchdog_configured
  ✅ safety.confidence_gates_configured
  ✅ rcan_v15.estop_qos_bypass
  ✅ rcan_v15.consent_declared
  ✅ rcan_v15.loa_enforcement
  ✅ rcan_v16.hardware_safety_core
  ✅ p66 block present

## Section 6 — Human Oversight Measures

Per Article 14, describe the human oversight measures implemented:

```
