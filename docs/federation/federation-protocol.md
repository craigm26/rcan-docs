# RCAN Federation Protocol

**Status:** Draft  
**Version:** 1.4  
**Authors:** RCAN Working Group  
**Related:** [Governance](../governance/robot-registry-foundation.md) · [RURI Specification](../spec/index.md) · [Conformance](https://rcan.dev/conformance)

> **v1.4 update:** Added REGISTRY_REGISTER (MessageType 13), REGISTRY_RESOLVE (14), REGISTRY_REGISTER_RESULT (16), REGISTRY_RESOLVE_RESULT (17) wire types. Ed25519 ownership verification in registry. `hardware_safety` field in `rcan-config.json`. P66 conformance manifest as federated discovery data.

---

## 1. Overview

The RCAN Federation Protocol defines how multiple independent robot registries interoperate to form a global, decentralised robot identity namespace — without any single point of control.

Federation is modelled after the Domain Name System (DNS): just as anyone can operate a DNS resolver or authoritative nameserver, anyone can host an RCAN registry for their own namespace. A robot's globally unique identity is embedded in its RURI, which encodes the authoritative registry that can resolve it.

> **Design principle:** No single organisation — including the RCAN Working Group — should be a required intermediary for robot identity resolution at runtime.

---

## 2. Why Federation?

Centralised identity registries create systemic risks:

| Risk | Centralised | Federated |
|---|---|---|
| Single point of failure | Registry outage breaks all resolution | Local/org registries continue independently |
| Vendor lock-in | One body controls all robot identities | Operators own their own namespace |
| Governance capture | One actor can revoke/alter identities | Independent registries protect their members |
| Scalability ceiling | One registry, millions of robots | Horizontal scaling across registries |
| Offline operation | Cloud-down = robots can't resolve | Local registries survive network partitions |

Federation ensures that:
- Manufacturers can run their own registries for their product lines.
- Enterprises can run internal registries for their robot fleets.
- Local/offline deployments resolve without any internet access.
- `rcan.dev` is a bootstrap anchor and governance reference — not a required runtime dependency.

---

## 3. RURI Structure and Federation Encoding

A Robot Uniform Resource Identifier (RURI) encodes the authoritative registry directly in its structure:

```
rcan://REGISTRY/MANUFACTURER/MODEL/DEVICE-ID
```

| Component | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `REGISTRY` | Hostname of the authoritative registry | `rcan.dev`, `robots.acme-corp.com`, `local.rcan` |
| `MANUFACTURER` | Manufacturer slug (lowercase, hyphens) | `boston-dynamics`, `universal-robots` |
| `MODEL` | Model slug (lowercase, hyphens) | `spot`, `ur10e` |
| `DEVICE-ID` | Unique device identifier (≥ 8 chars, lowercase + hyphens) | `a1b2c3d4e5f6` |

### 3.1 Extended Forms

```
# With port
rcan://registry.example.com:9000/manufacturer/model/device-id

# With capability path
rcan://registry.example.com/manufacturer/model/device-id/teleop

# With port and capability
rcan://registry.example.com:9000/manufacturer/model/device-id/camera
```

### 3.2 Self-Describing Resolution

Because the registry host is encoded in the RURI itself, **no central lookup is needed** to determine where to resolve a RURI. A resolver simply:

1. Parses the `REGISTRY` component from the RURI.
2. Constructs the registry API URL: `https://<REGISTRY>/api/rcan/v1/`
3. Queries that registry directly.

This is intentionally analogous to how DNS resolvers use the authoritative nameserver embedded in zone delegation records.

---

## 4. Registry Types

RCAN defines three classes of registry, distinguished by scope and authority level.

### 4.1 Root Registry — `rcan.dev`

The root registry is operated by the RCAN Working Group and serves as:

- The **registry of last resort** for robots without a dedicated organisational registry.
- The **bootstrap anchor** for federation: federated registries register themselves with the root so other parties can discover them.
- The **governance reference**: root registry policies are set by an independent governance body (see [Governance](../governance/robot-registry-foundation.md)).

The root registry **MUST NOT** be a required runtime dependency. If `rcan.dev` is unreachable, robot operations using organisational or local registries **MUST** continue normally.

**Root RURI example:**
```
rcan://rcan.dev/boston-dynamics/spot/bd-spot-001a2b3c
```

### 4.2 Organisational Registry

An organisational registry is hosted by a manufacturer, enterprise, or research institution for their own robot fleet or product line.

**Characteristics:**
- Operates under its own domain (e.g., `robots.acme-corp.com`)
- Authoritative for RURIs in its namespace
- Registers itself with the root registry for discoverability
- May choose to federate with other organisational registries

**Organisational RURI example:**
```
rcan://robots.acme-corp.com/acme/logistics-bot/lgb-00a1b2c3d4e5
```

### 4.3 Local Registry — `local.rcan`

A local registry operates within a private network (LAN, robot cell, facility) and resolves RURIs without any internet access. The reserved hostname `local.rcan` is used for local-scope registries, resolved via mDNS.

**Characteristics:**
- Operates on a private network; never routable on the public internet
- Uses mDNS service type `_rcan-registry._tcp` for discovery
- Resolves entirely offline
- Suitable for manufacturing cells, research labs, and air-gapped deployments

**Local RURI example:**
```
rcan://local.rcan/opencastor/rover/abc12345
```

> **Note:** Multiple local registries may exist on a network; the mDNS `priority` field determines preference.

### 4.4 Resolver Node

A Resolver node is operated by a fleet operator or enterprise. It has no namespace authority and cannot register new RRNs. Instead, it caches and proxies records from Authoritative nodes and the root, providing low-latency resolution for local fleets without a permanent internet dependency.

**Characteristics:**
- Operates under an internal or operator-controlled domain
- No delegation certificate required
- Caches records from Authoritative nodes and root with TTL enforcement
- Proxies resolution requests on cache miss
- MUST NOT register new RRNs in authoritative namespaces
- Suitable for fleet operators, enterprises, and research facilities

**Use case:** A logistics company running 500 Boston Dynamics robots deploys a Resolver node on their internal network. The Resolver caches `RRN-BD-*` records from `registry.boston-dynamics.com`, serving resolution requests locally even when the manufacturer's registry is temporarily unreachable.

**Resolver RURI example:**
```
# Resolver serves records from rcan://registry.boston-dynamics.com/...
# but is not itself an authoritative source
https://resolver.acme-logistics.internal/api/rcan/v1/
```

---

## 5. Resolution Chain

RCAN resolution follows a deterministic, priority-ordered chain. A resolver **MUST** attempt each step in order and return the result from the first successful step.

```
1. Local cache
       ↓  (cache miss or expired TTL)
2. Parse REGISTRY host from RURI
       ↓
3. Query registry API: GET https://<REGISTRY>/api/rcan/v1/robots/<rrn>
       ↓  (registry unreachable)
4. Fallback: query root registry rcan.dev (if configured)
       ↓  (root also unreachable)
5. Resolution failure → return REGISTRY_UNREACHABLE error
```

### 5.1 Cache Behaviour

- Cache entries **MUST** include the TTL returned by the registry (`cache_ttl_seconds` field).
- Default TTL if not specified: **300 seconds** (5 minutes).
- Cached federation proofs **SHOULD** be stored on persistent storage for offline resilience.
- Stale cache entries **MAY** be served when the registry is unreachable (implementations SHOULD log this).

### 5.2 Registry Query

A resolver queries the registry's REST API:

```http
GET https://<REGISTRY>/api/rcan/v1/robots/<rrn>
Accept: application/json
```

The registry responds with a **Federation Proof** (see §6).

### 5.3 Registry Discovery

If a registry hostname is unknown (first contact), a resolver **MAY** fetch the registry's well-known descriptor before querying:

```http
GET https://<REGISTRY>/.well-known/rcan-registry.json
```

See §7 for the descriptor schema.

---

## 6. Federation Proof

A federation proof is the signed, authoritative response from a registry confirming a robot's identity and registration status.

### 6.1 JSON Schema

  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-04T15:30:00Z",
  "chain_hash": "sha256:fedcba987654...",
  "attestation": "pending"
}
```

### 6.2 Field Definitions

| `pending` | Registration submitted, awaiting verification |
| `suspended` | Registration temporarily suspended (e.g., safety hold) |
| `revoked` | Registration permanently revoked |

### 6.3a v1.4 Federation Proof — Extended Fields

In RCAN protocol v1.4+, the federation proof is extended to include P66 safety data and ownership verification:

```json
{
  "registry_url": "https://rcan.dev",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000042",
  "robot_name": "Spot Unit Alpha",
  "registry_pubkey_hint": "sha256:abc123def456...",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-04T15:30:00Z",
  "chain_hash": "sha256:fedcba987654...",
  "attestation": "active",
  "owner_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "owner_pubkey_verified": true,
  "hardware_safety": {
    "estop_response_ms": 50,
    "sil_level": "SIL2",
    "watchdog_enabled": true,
    "iso_10218_compliant": true
  },
  "p66_manifest_url": "https://robot.local/api/p66/manifest.json",
  "p66_conformant": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `owner_pubkey` | string | ✅ v1.4 | Ed25519 public key of the robot's registered owner |
| `owner_pubkey_verified` | bool | ✅ v1.4 | Whether the registry has verified ownership via Ed25519 challenge |
| `hardware_safety` | object | ✅ v1.4 (P66) | Hardware safety capabilities declared in `rcan-config.json` |
| `hardware_safety.estop_response_ms` | integer | — | Maximum ESTOP response time in milliseconds |
| `hardware_safety.sil_level` | string | — | IEC 61508 SIL level (`"SIL1"`, `"SIL2"`, `"SIL3"`) |
| `hardware_safety.watchdog_enabled` | bool | — | Hardware watchdog MCU present and active |
| `hardware_safety.iso_10218_compliant` | bool | — | Robot hardware meets ISO 10218-1/2 requirements |
| `p66_manifest_url` | string (URL) | ✅ v1.4 (P66) | URL of the robot's P66 conformance manifest |
| `p66_conformant` | bool | ✅ v1.4 (P66) | Whether this robot has passed P66 conformance testing |

### 6.4 Proof Verification

Resolvers **SHOULD** verify federation proofs by:

1. Fetching the registry's public key from `public_key_url` (from the registry's `.well-known` descriptor).
2. Verifying the proof signature against the `registry_pubkey_hint` fingerprint.
3. Checking `timestamp_iso` is within acceptable skew (recommended: ±5 minutes).
4. Validating `chain_hash` against the previous proof in the chain (for audit integrity).

### 6.4a Node Trust Verification

When resolving a delegated RRN (format `RRN-{PREFIX}-{SEQUENCE}`) from an Authoritative node, clients MUST perform a full node trust verification in addition to the proof verification steps in §6.4:

1. **Fetch the node manifest** from `https://<authoritative-node>/.well-known/rcan-node.json`.
2. **Extract the delegation cert** from the manifest's `delegation_cert` field.
3. **Verify the delegation cert signature** using root's Ed25519 public key (obtained from `https://rcan.dev/.well-known/rcan-node.json`). The signature covers the canonical JSON of the cert (all fields except `root_signature`).
4. **Check cert expiry**: `expires_at` MUST be in the future.
5. **Verify namespace match**: the `namespace_prefix` in the cert MUST match the prefix extracted from the RRN being resolved.
6. **Verify the record signature**: the robot record's `node_signature` MUST be valid against the node's `public_key` from the manifest.

If any verification step fails, the resolver MUST return the appropriate error code (see §10 Error Codes) and MUST NOT serve the record.

```
# Full trust verification chain
root.pubkey (pinned from rcan.dev/.well-known/rcan-node.json)
    → verifies → delegation_cert.root_signature
        → delegation_cert binds → node.pubkey
            → verifies → record.node_signature
                → record is trusted
```

## 7. Running a Federated Registry

Any organisation can operate an RCAN-conformant registry. The requirements are intentionally minimal.

### 7.1 Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| **RCAN API** | Implement the RCAN Registry REST API (see §7.2) |
| **Well-Known Descriptor** | Publish `/.well-known/rcan-registry.json` (see §7.3) |
| **Public Key** | Publish a public key for proof signing; link from descriptor |
| **Open API** | The registry API **MUST** be publicly accessible (no auth required for reads) |
| **TLS** | HTTPS required; valid certificate required |
| **Root Registration** | Register with root registry `rcan.dev` for global discoverability |

### 7.2 Required API Endpoints

A conformant registry **MUST** implement the following endpoints at its `api_base`:

```
GET  {api_base}/robots/{rrn}             → federation proof
GET  {api_base}/robots?manufacturer=...  → list robots (filterable)
GET  {api_base}/robots/{rrn}/capabilities → capability listing
POST {api_base}/robots                   → register a robot (authenticated)
GET  {api_base}/status                   → registry health/version
```

### 7.3 .well-known/rcan-registry.json Schema

Every registry **MUST** publish a descriptor at `/.well-known/rcan-registry.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "ACME Robotics Registry",
  "operator": "ACME Corporation",
  "rcan_version": "1.2",
  "api_base": "https://robots.acme-corp.com/api/rcan/v1",
  "public_key_url": "https://robots.acme-corp.com/.well-known/rcan-registry.pub",
  "federation_root": "https://rcan.dev"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | ✅ | Human-readable registry name |
| `operator` | string | ✅ | Organisation operating this registry |
| `rcan_version` | string | ✅ | RCAN spec version this registry conforms to (e.g., `"1.2"`) |
| `api_base` | string (URL) | ✅ | Base URL for the RCAN Registry REST API |
| `public_key_url` | string (URL) | ✅ | URL to fetch the registry's public signing key (PEM format) |
| `federation_root` | string (URL) | ✅ | Root registry this registry federates with (typically `https://rcan.dev`) |

### 7.4 Step-by-Step: Launch a Federated Registry

**Step 1 — Implement the API**

Implement the required endpoints from §7.2. Reference implementations are available:
- [rcan-registry-reference](https://github.com/continuonai/rcan-spec/tree/main/examples/registry) (TypeScript / Node.js)

**Step 2 — Generate and Publish Your Key Pair**

```bash
# Generate Ed25519 key pair
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out registry-private.pem
openssl pkey -in registry-private.pem -pubout -out registry-public.pem

# Publish registry-public.pem at /.well-known/rcan-registry.pub
```

**Step 3 — Publish .well-known/rcan-registry.json**

Serve the descriptor at `https://your-registry.example.com/.well-known/rcan-registry.json` with the fields from §7.3.

**Step 4 — Validate Conformance**

Run the RCAN conformance checker against your registry:

```bash
python3 scripts/conformance/check_l1.py \
  --host your-registry.example.com \
  --port 443 \
  --registry-mode
```

**Step 5 — Register with the Root**

Submit your registry to `rcan.dev` so it is discoverable by the broader RCAN ecosystem:

```http
POST https://rcan.dev/api/rcan/v1/federation/registries
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "registry_url": "https://your-registry.example.com",
  "well_known_url": "https://your-registry.example.com/.well-known/rcan-registry.json"
}
```

The root registry will fetch and validate your `.well-known` descriptor, verify your API conformance, and add your registry to the federation index.

---

## 8a. Node Registration Process

Any manufacturer or organisation wishing to operate an Authoritative node and register RRNs under a dedicated prefix MUST complete the following process.

### Application

Submit a node registration request to root:

```http
POST https://rcan.dev/api/rcan/v1/delegations/apply
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "organisation": "Boston Dynamics, Inc.",
  "contact_email": "registry@bostondynamics.com",
  "requested_prefix": "BD",
  "node_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com",
  "well_known_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com/.well-known/rcan-node.json",
  "node_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "justification": "Manufacturer registry for all Boston Dynamics robot product lines."
}
```

Root will:
1. Verify the `well_known_url` is reachable and returns a valid node manifest.
2. Verify the `node_pubkey` matches the key published in the manifest.
3. Check that the `requested_prefix` is available (2–6 uppercase ASCII, not already delegated).
4. Review the application (automated checks + manual approval for new prefixes).
5. If approved, issue a signed delegation certificate and add the prefix to the `namespace_delegations` table.

### Certificate Issuance

Upon approval, root generates and signs the delegation cert:

```json
{
  "namespace_prefix": "BD",
  "node_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com",
  "node_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "granted_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2027-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "root_signature": "ed25519:<signed-by-root-private-key>"
}
```

The applicant MUST embed this cert in their `/.well-known/rcan-node.json` manifest before registering any RRNs.

### Renewal

Delegation certs MUST be renewed before `expires_at`. Renewal uses the same endpoint; an existing cert is required to authenticate the renewal request. Root SHOULD send renewal reminders 30 and 7 days before expiry.

---

## 8b. Sync Protocol

Authoritative nodes synchronise records to root using a combination of periodic pull and optional webhook push.

### Pull Sync (Required)

Every Authoritative node MUST periodically pull sync from its parent (root or an intermediate Authoritative node):

1. **Poll interval**: Every `sync_interval_seconds` (default: 3600 seconds, minimum: 60 seconds).
2. **Request**: `GET {parent}/api/rcan/v1/sync?since={last_sync_iso}&node={node_url}`
3. **Response**: JSON sync payload (see §17.7 Wire Format in the spec) containing all records changed since `last_sync_iso`.
4. **Apply**: Node applies the received changes to its local store.
5. **Conflict resolution**: If the same RRN exists with differing values, the root record MUST win.
6. **Timestamp update**: Node records the current time as `synced_at` for the next poll.

On failure, nodes MUST use exponential backoff (initial: 60s, maximum: 3600s).

### Webhook Push (Recommended)

Nodes SHOULD register a webhook URL with their parent to receive push notifications when records change:

```http
POST https://rcan.dev/api/rcan/v1/nodes/webhooks
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "node_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com",
  "webhook_url": "https://registry.boston-dynamics.com/api/rcan/v1/webhook",
  "secret": "sha256:<hmac-secret-for-verification>"
}
```

When a record changes, the parent POSTs a sync payload to all registered webhook URLs. The receiver MUST validate the `X-RCAN-Signature` HMAC header before processing.

### Sync Security

- All sync requests and webhook deliveries MUST use HTTPS.
- Sync responses MUST be signed with the sending node's Ed25519 private key.
- Receivers MUST verify the signature before applying any changes.
- A sync message with `to_node` not matching the receiver's own URL MUST be rejected.

---

## 8. Root Registry Governance

`rcan.dev` serves as the root registry and federation anchor. Its operation **MUST** be governed by an independent body to prevent capture by any single commercial or governmental interest.

Governance responsibilities include:
- Setting and updating the RCAN specification.
- Operating the root registry `rcan.dev` with defined uptime SLAs.
- Maintaining the federation index of registered organisational registries.
- Establishing policies for registry suspension or revocation.
- Publishing the governance charter and meeting records publicly.

> **See:** [Governance](../governance/robot-registry-foundation.md) for the full governance charter, board composition, and decision-making process.

The root registry **MUST NOT** be used as a runtime dependency for local or organisational registries. Its role is bootstrap, governance, and discoverability — not operational control.

---

## 9. Security Considerations

### 9.1 Registry Impersonation

Because the registry hostname is encoded in the RURI, a malicious actor could craft a RURI pointing to a fake registry. Mitigations:

- Always verify the federation proof signature against the registry's published public key.
- For high-security deployments, pin allowed registry hostnames in the resolver configuration.
- The root registry federation index provides a canonical list of registered organisational registries.

### 9.2 Key Rotation

Registries **MUST** support key rotation without service interruption:

- Publish new key at least 24 hours before the old key expires.
- The `registry_pubkey_hint` in federation proofs identifies which key was used for signing.
- Old proofs signed with the prior key remain verifiable for their `chain_hash` continuity.

### 9.3 Replay Attacks

Federation proofs include `timestamp_iso`. Resolvers **MUST** reject proofs with timestamps more than 5 minutes in the past or future (subject to reasonable clock skew).

### 9.4 Offline and Air-Gapped Deployments

Local registries (`local.rcan`) are designed for offline operation. For air-gapped deployments:
- Pre-load the registry's public key at deployment time.
- Use cached federation proofs with extended TTLs.
- Disable root registry fallback in the resolver configuration.

---

## 10. Appendix: Error Codes

| Code | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 6001 | `REGISTRY_UNREACHABLE` | Could not connect to the registry at the RURI's host |
| 6002 | `FEDERATION_PROOF_INVALID` | Proof signature verification failed |
| 6003 | `FEDERATION_PROOF_EXPIRED` | Proof `timestamp_iso` is outside acceptable skew |
| 6004 | `REGISTRY_NOT_FOUND` | Registry is not registered with the root federation index |
| 6005 | `CHAIN_HASH_MISMATCH` | `chain_hash` does not match expected value (audit chain broken) |
| 6006 | `ROBOT_NOT_REGISTERED` | RRN not found in the queried registry |
| 6007 | `ROBOT_SUSPENDED` | Robot registration is currently suspended |
| 6008 | `ROBOT_REVOKED` | Robot registration has been permanently revoked |

### Distributed Node Protocol Error Codes (§17)

The following codes are specific to the Distributed Registry Node Protocol (§17). They are returned when resolving delegated RRNs or during node-to-node sync operations.

| Code | Name | HTTP Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6001 | `NODE_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | No Authoritative node is registered for the RRN prefix. The prefix may not be delegated or may have been revoked. |
| 6002 | `DELEGATION_INVALID` | 403 | Node delegation certificate signature verification failed. The cert may be expired, tampered with, or signed by an unrecognised key. |
| 6003 | `RECORD_SIG_INVALID` | 403 | Robot record signature verification failed. The record may have been tampered with in transit or after registration. |
| 6004 | `SYNC_CONFLICT` | 409 | A sync conflict was detected (same RRN with differing values at node and root). Root record wins; the conflicting node record has been overwritten. |
| 6005 | `NODE_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | The Authoritative node for this RRN prefix is currently unreachable. No valid cached record is available. |
| 6006 | `CACHE_STALE` | 206 | A cached record was found but its TTL has expired. A live fetch from the Authoritative node failed. The stale record is returned; callers SHOULD decide whether to accept it or treat as unavailable. |

**Note on code numbering:** The §17 node protocol error codes reuse the 6001–6006 range for node-specific errors. Implementations SHOULD include a `domain` field in error responses (`"domain": "federation"` or `"domain": "node-protocol"`) to disambiguate when codes overlap.

## 11. RCAN Wire Types for Registry Operations

These MessageTypes for registry operations were introduced in the RCAN protocol (see [rcan.dev/compatibility](https://rcan.dev/compatibility)) and define how robots and clients register and resolve RRNs directly via the RCAN message protocol (not just via REST API).

### 11.1 MessageType Table (Registry)

| MessageType | Value | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `REGISTRY_REGISTER` | 13 | Client → Registry | Request to register a new robot or update an existing registration |
| `REGISTRY_RESOLVE` | 14 | Client → Registry | Request to resolve an RRN to a federation proof |
| `REGISTRY_REGISTER_RESULT` | 16 | Registry → Client | Result of a REGISTRY_REGISTER operation |
| `REGISTRY_RESOLVE_RESULT` | 17 | Registry → Client | Result of a REGISTRY_RESOLVE operation (federation proof payload) |

### 11.2 REGISTRY_REGISTER (MessageType 13)

```json
{
  "message_type": 13,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/acme/logistics-bot/lgb-abc123",
  "robot_name": "Logistics Bot Alpha",
  "owner_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA...",
  "owner_signature": "ed25519:<signature-over-canonical-registration-payload>",
  "hardware_safety": {
    "estop_response_ms": 80,
    "sil_level": "SIL1",
    "watchdog_enabled": false,
    "iso_10218_compliant": false
  },
  "p66_manifest_url": "https://lgb-abc123.robots.acme.com/api/p66/manifest.json",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Ownership verification:** The `owner_signature` field MUST be an Ed25519 signature of the canonical registration payload (JSON with all fields except `owner_signature`, sorted by key, serialised without whitespace), signed with the private key corresponding to `owner_pubkey`. The registry MUST verify this signature before assigning an RRN.

### 11.3 REGISTRY_REGISTER_RESULT (MessageType 16)

```json
{
  "message_type": 16,
  "status": "registered",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000099",
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/acme/logistics-bot/lgb-abc123",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T12:00:01Z",
  "error": null

## 12. What a Federated Robot Ecosystem Looks Like

This section provides a concrete walkthrough of how two robots on the same local network discover each other, verify identity, and communicate via RCAN — with the RRF providing the trust anchor.

### Cast

| Robot | RRN | Host | Registry |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bob** | `RRN-000000000001` | `robot.local` | `rcan.dev` (root) |
| **Alex** | `RRN-000000000005` | `alex.local` | `rcan.dev` (root) |

Both robots are registered with the RRF root registry. Both are running the RCAN runtime and are online on the same LAN.

---

### Step 1 — Bob registers with RRF on first boot

Bob's runtime sends a `REGISTRY_REGISTER` (MessageType 13) to `rcan.dev`:

```json
{
  "message_type": 13,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "robot_name": "Bob",
  "owner_pubkey": "ed25519:MCowBQYDK2VwAyEA<BOB_PUBKEY>",
  "owner_signature": "ed25519:<sig-over-payload>",
  "hardware_safety": {
    "estop_response_ms": 45,
    "sil_level": "SIL1",
    "watchdog_enabled": true,
    "iso_10218_compliant": true
  },
  "p66_manifest_url": "http://robot.local/api/p66/manifest.json",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T08:00:00Z"
}
```

RRF verifies the Ed25519 signature, assigns `RRN-000000000001`, and responds with `REGISTRY_REGISTER_RESULT` (MessageType 16):

```json
{
  "message_type": 16,
  "status": "registered",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000001",
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T08:00:01Z"
}
```

---

### Step 2 — Alex discovers Bob via RCAN DISCOVER

Alex's runtime broadcasts a `DISCOVER` message (MessageType 6) on the local network via mDNS:

```json
{
  "message_type": 6,
  "ruri": "rcan://local/*",
  "capabilities": ["status", "command"],
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T09:00:00Z"
}
```

Bob's runtime receives the DISCOVER and responds with its own RURI and basic identity:

```json
{
  "message_type": 7,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000001",
  "robot_name": "Bob",
  "capabilities": ["status", "command", "estop"],
  "registry": "https://rcan.dev"
}
```

---

### Step 3 — Alex verifies Bob's identity via REGISTRY_RESOLVE

Before trusting Bob, Alex resolves his RRN against the registry. Alex sends `REGISTRY_RESOLVE` (MessageType 14) to `rcan.dev`:

```json
{
  "message_type": 14,
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000001",
  "requester_ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/alex-005",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T09:00:05Z"
}
```

RRF responds with `REGISTRY_RESOLVE_RESULT` (MessageType 17) containing the full federation proof including Bob's P66 manifest URL.

Alex verifies the proof: Ed25519 signature valid, `owner_pubkey_verified: true`, `p66_conformant: true`. **Bob is trusted.**

---

### Step 4 — Alex sends a COMMAND to Bob

With identity verified, Alex sends a direct RCAN COMMAND (MessageType 3) to Bob:

```json
{
  "message_type": 3,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "action": "status",
  "sender_ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/alex-005",
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T09:00:10Z"
}
```

---

### Step 5 — Bob responds with STATUS including P66 manifest

Bob's runtime handles the COMMAND and responds with a STATUS message (MessageType 2):

```json
{
  "message_type": 2,
  "ruri": "rcan://rcan.dev/opencastor/rover/bob-001",
  "rrn": "RRN-000000000001",
  "state": "idle",
  "battery_pct": 87,
  "uptime_s": 3600,
  "p66_manifest_url": "http://robot.local/api/p66/manifest.json",
  "hardware_safety": {
    "estop_response_ms": 45,
    "sil_level": "SIL1",
    "watchdog_enabled": true
  },
  "timestamp_iso": "2026-03-14T09:00:11Z"
}
```

Alex receives the status, inspects the P66 manifest URL, and optionally fetches Bob's full conformance manifest to verify safety posture before issuing any further commands.

---

### Summary: Trust Chain in a Federated Ecosystem

```
RRF root (rcan.dev)
  ├── issues RRN-000000000001 to Bob  (Ed25519-verified at registration)
  ├── issues RRN-000000000005 to Alex
  └── provides REGISTRY_RESOLVE_RESULT with signed federation proof
         ↓
Alex resolves Bob's identity → verifies Ed25519 proof → trusts Bob
         ↓
Alex → COMMAND (MessageType 3) → Bob
Bob → STATUS (MessageType 2) + P66 manifest URL → Alex
```

No central broker is required at runtime. The RRF provides identity anchoring; Alex and Bob communicate peer-to-peer once trust is established.
